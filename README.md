# runner

This is an infinite runner game, a lot like google's offline dinosaur game.

I have used Pygame in this project.

The pixel art and animations of the player character, the enemies, and the game background were sourced from "o_lobster" from website itch.io
All the sound effects and music were sourced from "Beep Yeah" from website itch.io

The starting menu and the grass were sprites created by me.

I loosely followed this tutorial to make the game:
