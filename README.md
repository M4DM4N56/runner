This is an infinite runner game, similar to Google's offline dinosaur game.

I have used Pygame in this project.

The code and concept of this game is loosely based off:
Clear Code: youtube.com/watch?v=AY9MnQ4x3zk&t=9332s

The starting menu and the grass were sprites created by me.
Background images, foreground sprites, sound effects, and music were legally acquired via itch.io
